  <h2>Major Changes at Real Madrid – Xabi Alonso Departs, Álvaro Arbeloa Appointed Head Coach</h1>

  <p>
    Real Madrid’s recent run of matches has triggered significant changes behind the scenes.
    While the results were not disastrous, the overall performances failed to meet the club’s
    extremely high standards.
  </p>

  <p>
    After internal discussions, the club made the difficult decision to part ways with
    <strong>Xabi Alonso</strong>.
    The departure was not based solely on results, but also on deeper issues within the squad.
  </p>

  <p>
    According to sources close to the club, Xabi Alonso’s relationship with several key players
    had deteriorated in recent weeks.
    Tensions reportedly arose over tactical decisions, squad rotation and communication,
    leading to a loss of confidence inside the dressing room.
  </p>

  <p>
    While Alonso remains a respected club legend, Real Madrid’s management felt that the
    growing disconnect between the coach and the players was beginning to affect performances
    on the pitch.
    At a club where harmony and authority are essential, this situation became unsustainable.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a result, <strong>Álvaro Arbeloa</strong> was appointed as the new head coach.
    Having worked successfully within Real Madrid’s youth system, Arbeloa knows the club’s identity,
    values and expectations better than most.
  </p>

  <p>
    Arbeloa is expected to focus on restoring unity within the squad,
    improving defensive organization and implementing a faster, more aggressive transition game.
    Early signs suggest a renewed sense of discipline and motivation among the players.
  </p>

  <p>
    The upcoming matches will be crucial in determining whether this coaching change marks
    the beginning of a new and successful chapter for Real Madrid.

  <h2>Real Madrid 2025/26 – Current Squad, Form and Season Overview</h1>

  <p>
    The <strong>Real Madrid</strong> squad for the 2025/26 season is once again among the strongest in world football.
    With a perfect mix of elite stars and young talent, expectations remain extremely high both domestically and in Europe.
  </p>

  <p>
    The attacking line is led by 
    <a href="https://mbappe-six.vercel.app" title="Kylian Mbappé Real Madrid statistics">
      Kylian Mbappé
    </a>,
    whose pace, finishing ability and constant movement have made him a decisive figure since his arrival.
    His presence has completely changed the dynamic of Real Madrid’s offensive play.
  </p>

  <p>
    In midfield, the team continues to benefit from a powerful blend of energy and intelligence.
    Jude Bellingham remains a key leader, while Federico Valverde and Eduardo Camavinga provide intensity,
    versatility and balance on both sides of the ball.
  </p>

  <p>
    Defensively, the season has been challenging at times due to injuries and rotation,
    but Real Madrid still ranks among the strongest defensive units in the league.
    The back line has shown resilience, especially in high-pressure matches.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, the team’s form has been slightly inconsistent, but the quality and depth of the squad
    leave no doubt that Real Madrid has the potential to peak at the decisive stage of the season.
